ALEMBIC APPLICATION BOOSTRAPPING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thers probably a better way to handle this but this has worked great for me so
far.  We instantiate out application using our factory passing in the desired
environement pulled from the alembic config section.  This is specified on the
command line using the -n NAME flag.

This allows us to neatly tie all of out database configuration state into one object.
As the pattern defined in this template is to pull all your models into your views the
application factory will ensure all the modls are picked up by alembic Thus ensuring that
autogenerate will find any changes you have made for you.
